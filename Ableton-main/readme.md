# Replicating Ableton About Page

**Design:** https://www.ableton.com/en/about/
**Implementation:** https://ableton-taupe.vercel.app/

Trying to revise my CSS skills replicating different websites online. This is one of them. 

#### Previous components I worked on in February 2024

 Earlier in January 2024, I wrote the code for some component design from my friend's [Behance](KOOM SOLOMON) portfolio. He's [Koom Solomon](https://dribbble.com/KOOM_S).
